FinderLinkHelper
================

This is a combination of tools that allow you to create / open links with a "finder://" URI scheme, including "relative to your home directory" links

Opening the links *require* the helper application to be installed on the Mac where someone attempts to click the link.

How to use:
===========

The important files are the .workflows and the .applescript.

The .workflows are used to create OS X services which are available when you right-click on a file/files in the Finder.

If you double-click the .workflows in the Finder, they will prompt to install (and end up in ~/Library/Services).

They add two right-click menu choices (under the 'Services' section at the bottom:
* "Finder Link - Relative"
* "Finder Link - Absolute"

Using Relative will generate links that if the original file is contained within your home directory (normally at /Users/yourname), the link you share with someone will open one located at a similar path in *their* home directory.

Using Absolute will instead always start from the root directory (/). So if your username is "mike", a link to a file on your Desktop named "example.txt" will include: /Users/mike/example.txt. Such a link would only open for the person you send it to if they also have a "/Users/mike/example.txt" (that exact file path) on their computer.

If you choose Relative but the file is located outside of your user home, it will generate an Absolute-style link.

If the file is not available, you'll get an error dialog showing what it attempted to open.
